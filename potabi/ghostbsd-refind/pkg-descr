rEFInd is a fork of the rEFIt boot manager. Like rEFIt, rEFInd can auto-detect
your installed EFI boot loaders and it presents a pretty GUI menu of boot
options. rEFInd goes beyond rEFIt in that rEFInd better handles systems with
many boot loaders, gives better control over the boot loader search process,
and provides the ability for users to define their own boot loader entries.
