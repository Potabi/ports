This package is not a normal Lumina Desktop Environment install. Due to how
Ayras is a very incomplete fork of Lumina, some important things have not
changed making the two incompatible.

This meta-package installs all the packages related to the Lumina desktop
(specifically Potabi's Ayras desktop environment fork, which is a modified 
Lumina). If you want more fine-grained control over the installed utilities, 
please install the individual x11/lumina-* and deskutils/lumina-* packages 
instead.
